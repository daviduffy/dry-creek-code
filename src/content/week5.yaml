  "<p>I'll be out of town this week! If you're out of ideas, I have two thoughts for what you can do this week:</p>
  <ul><li>'Creating Art with Code' lets you program instructions for the computer to draw shapes.
  If you loop instructions, it can make cool designs!</li>
  <li>The second link, 'Build your own business in Coding Town' is a Minecraft-like world where you'll
  build a store and sell things!</li></ul>"
