heading: Week 2

tease:
  This week we are talking all about HTML!  If you have ever used a word processing program like
  Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you've probably applied formatting to blocks of text. HTML
  serves a similar purpose by offering text formatting instructions to web browsers through
  tags known as markup.
topics:
  - hypertext markup language
  - using heading and paragraph tags

        When the new **Copper Expansion** came out for Minecraft, I couldn’t wait to play. I built a whole copper castle, complete with shiny copper doors and a lightning rod tower.

        But that night, something weird happened. I dreamed I was walking through my castle — except it wasn’t a dream! My arms were made of copper blocks! Every time I moved, I made little *clink clink* noises.

        In the morning, my mom said I looked a little “metallic.” I told her not to worry… as long as I didn’t start rusting.
